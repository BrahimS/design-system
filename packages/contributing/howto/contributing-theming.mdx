# Theming

All components use the theming system.

Defining a theme means define some configuration as following:
* **colorConfig**: all the defined color palettes with hsl CSS colors
* **sizeConfig**: all the defined size properties for each component
* **typographyConfig**: all the defined typography properties for each component
