## Description
The Accordion component is a container with some large content that can be collapsed and expanded.
The `typography` is already set with the correct levels.
`A click` on the arrow icon will expand or collapse the content.
An accordion can be `disabled` if you don't want to allow user to see the content.
It can be `contrasted` in the selected color.
The accordion can be set at start as `expanded` with `opened` attribute.
Each time an expand or collapse is released, an event `odsAccordionToggle` is fired.

## Zoning
The component has two content: a summary as a title and a content.

<osds-accordion opened style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }}>

  Content
</osds-accordion>

## Colors
All available colors can be applied on the accordion : default, primary, text, accent, error, warning, success, info and promotion

## Sizes
It has for now only one size `md`.
