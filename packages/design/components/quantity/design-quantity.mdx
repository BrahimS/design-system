## Description
The Quantity component is used to choose the quantity of a selected item. It has different UIs, but they all have the
same purpose.

This component might use [Input]() and [Button]().
Please note that osd-input or native input can be used as input and any component can be used as controls.

## Zoning
The component contains a quantity container and a way to change it freely.
There are three areas:

Basic use is with two [Button](/)s and an [Input]().
There are two controls: minus control is used to lower the quantity and plus control is used to increase the quantity.
There is a content area where quantity is displayed.
Keyboard and steps (through + / - controls) can be used to select the quantity or directly on changing the value in the input.

## Colors
Colors don't apply directly to Quantity but come from used component (ie.Input and Button components)

## States
Here are the states Quantity can have:

<DesignQuantityStates />

## Behaviours
Quantity is aware when minimal / maximal value has been reached. In this case the minus / plus control is disabled.

## Contrasted
Contrasted doesn't apply directly to Quantity. It comes from used components (ie.Input and Button components).
