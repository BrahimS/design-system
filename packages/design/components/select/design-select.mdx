## Description
The Select component allows the user to choose a value from a list of options.
It is mainly used in a form.

## Zoning
The Select component has:
- a field to represent the Select itself that can be open and closed by clicking on it
- an icon that informs the Select can be open
- (optional) a group title used to group related options
- a list of options

<div style={{ height: '180px' }}>
<osds-select size='md' opened style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }}>
  <span slot='placeholder'>Placeholder</span>
  <osds-select-group>Group title</osds-select-group>
  <osds-select-option value="1">Option title 1</osds-select-option>
  <osds-select-option value="2">Option title 2</osds-select-option>
  <osds-select-option value="3">Option title 3</osds-select-option>
</osds-select>
</div>

## Colors
Only one color is applied on the Select: Primary.
The primary color from your theme is applied.

## Sizes
The Select exists in a unique size but it can be widened to match its container.
To do so, you have to use the flex option (auto-resize to the parent container).

## Behaviours
A Select can be focused, hovered and disabled.
Option title will be truncated when it cannot fit on a single line.
From ten items in the Select, a scroll bar will be automatically displayed to allow a better navigation.
The field has to be touched by the user (dirty) before any check. This check will be done when exiting the Select. It also can be done by calling validate method.
