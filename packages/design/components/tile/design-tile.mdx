## Description
The tile is the container for data presentation or selection. When it's interactive it can be used with CSS pseudo-elements which allow us to manage a style for selection. It displays a wide variety of content and can be used for presenting options to the user.

## Zoning

## Variants

## Colors
Each palette can be applied to the tile.

## Sizes

## States
The disabled tile is presented with a less important opacity and it has no ability of interaction (no hover, no focus,
no click).

## Flex
The tile can be adapted to the parent's container with flex. In this case, the width of the tile no longer fit the
text, but grow to a full percentage of the parent's width.
