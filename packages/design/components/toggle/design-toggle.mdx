## Description
The toggle is a container for data presentation or selection. When it is interactive, it can be used with CSS pseudo-elements, which allow us to manage a style for selection.
It displays a wide variety of content and can be used for presenting options to the user.

## Colors
Each palette can be applied to the toggle.

## Behaviours
Each toggle behaviour is defined here, whether it is keyboard-related or mouse-related.

## Flex
The toggle can be adapted to the parent's container with flex. In this case, the width of the toggle no longer fit the
text, but grow to a full percentage of the parent's width.
