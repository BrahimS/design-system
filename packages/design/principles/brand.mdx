# Branding
OVH requests that all its partners strictly abide by these guidelines. They ensure the consistency and better visibility of our products, solutions and services.

The graphic charter that you have in your hands explains how our logos should be used in various contexts.

These guidelines, which include clear instructions, will enable you to maintain visual coherence with our identity in all circumstances.

## Six principles of using the logo
These six rules are the essential principles for using the logos. They must be strictly abided by to maintain the consistency of OVH’s image.

Use the logo exclusively in its complete form (graphic + logotype) and keep all proportions identical to the original.

Use the company logo in its form with two colours as priority; if this version is illegible, use the version with the black background.

Do not reproduce the logo using shades other than those shown in the graphic charter.

Ensure that the logo’s format and size are appropriate so that it can be both easily seen and read.

Do not position the logo with two colours on a patterned background for example. Instead, position it on a white background.

Centre it (in accordance with the exclusion diagram - The exclusion is equal to capitals height.).

The method for calculating the length of the graph is the length of the type divided by three to which a length of "x" is added

## Font - Bariol Regular

You must use the Barriol regular width font type. Please note that the font is only used for the logotype.
