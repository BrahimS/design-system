# Iconography
_Icons are symbols that represent functionality or content. They’re especially recognisable and helpful in user interfaces since their meaning can be understood at a glance. hough they can be used just for decoration, their full potential can be realised when they’re used meaningfully and consistently._

## Accessibility
_For icons that convey a meaning or serve a function, add the necessary support for screen readers. You can skip this for decorative icons._

## Style
_Make sure that your icon family makes visual sense as a whole. Picking an outlined or filled style and sticking with it will lead to better visual consistency and predictability._

## Naming
_Name your icons based on what they are, not what they represent. For instance, a trash icon should be named trash, not delete. You can still add related keywords to improve discoverability._

## Relation with grid
_Draw your icons in a bounding box that plays well with your grid. This makes for a better pairing with other UI elements. A good example of this would be icons with bounding boxes paired with text._

## Sizes
_Provide different sizes for icons that correlate to your grid. Provide a minimum size and remove unnecessary detail for your icons for smaller sizes._

## Keywords
_Adding keywords will improve the discoverability of each icon and provide a better user experience for anyone using your system._

## Reserved icons
_Reserving icons that represent common actions will prevent their use in any other context. System icons for navigation or adding and deleting are a good example. This leads to a more intuitive user experience._

## Guidelines
_Provide guidelines on how and when to use icons, what to keep in mind when working with them and how not to use them._
