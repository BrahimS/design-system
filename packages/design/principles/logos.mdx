# Logos
_Most customers form an opinion about a product in seconds. In most cases, your logo will be the first brand asset someone sees. It’s all about making the right first impression. A distinctive logo helps users recognise a product immediately and gives them the essence of your branding._

## Monochrome version
_A monochrome version of your logo that looks good on top of photography or when it’s printed with a poor quality printer._

## Small use guidance
_Your logo must perform well and be recognisable at all sizes. Tips for using your logo in these cases will minimise the risk of it being misused._

## Placement and clearance guidance
_Your logo must come with clear guidance on how to place it and how to preserve its space since it lives along with other content._

## Usage guidance
_These are the logo crimes, providing contextual examples of what to (not) do with your logo._

## Different file formats
_Providing a variety of formats for the vector version of your logo will make it easier for others to work and prevent anyone from redrawing it._
