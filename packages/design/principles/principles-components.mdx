# Components principles
_All components have to follow some rules about color,
size, variant and contrast_

## Color
Each component take as input the color.
If no color is specified, the default one is applied.

the color can be:

| size    | description |
|---------|-------------|
| default<br />`by default` | mainly no color            |
| primary | the most used color |
| accent  | used to render visible a specific component, like CTAs buttons|
| error   | the component is in error state |
| warning | the component have a warning to notice |
| info    | the component have a info to notice |
| success | the component is in a done success |

## Size
Each component can have different sizes.
If no size is specified, the `m` (middle) size is applied.

- xs
- sm
- md `by default`
- lg
- xl

The `size` attribute is an `enum` and set by default to `m`

## Variant
Each component can have some variant.
They are specific for each component.
A variant is an alternative design for the same component.

For instance, the `button` component have some variants:
<DesignButtonVariants />

The `variant` attribute is an `enum` and set by default to the default variant.

## Contrasted
A component can be displayed in a `contrasted` way.
When a component is placed on top of another with the same `color` for both,
the second has to be contrasted.

For instance, if we have a cart with a `primary` color (applied on background)
and we have to place a button inside it.
If the button have to be displayed in `primary` color too,
we can have a contrast problem : same color on cart's background
and in button's background.
To avoid this, the contrast notion allow us to display a component
in a contrasted way.
So, here the button has to be contrasted.

The `contrasted` attribute is a `boolean` and set by default to `false`

## Disabled
Each component can be deactivated, and the user cannot interact with it.

The `disabled` attribute is a `boolean` and set by default to `false`
