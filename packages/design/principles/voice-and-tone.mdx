# Voice and Tone

## Technical, precise and professional vocabulary

The words we use should reflect our level of technical expertise, and our business-to-business (B2B) target. Our objective is not to use a lot of jargon or lack clarity; it is to give a precise name for each element, use appropriate terms, and add explanations, references, information boxes or notes if they make the information more reader-friendly.

> Example: "The problem that the OVHcloud's SOC team decided to tackle a year and a half ago is more complex. It involves curbing the proliferation of malware and ransomware, with the latter being particularly widespread for the last three years. These malicious programs infect computers and servers to encrypt their data and steal it from owners, or send it to third parties via setups that are far more elaborate than those used by offshore financial services institutions. Sometimes, it also involves taking control of machines to form a botnet network, with the aim of generating distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. To trace these programs right back to their designers, the majority of whom are based in Eastern Europe (mainly Russia and Ukraine), Frank Denis has had to adopt a more cunning approach. His techniques are drawn from computing and reverse engineering, as well as old policing methods which focus on hide-outs and searching for those committing obvious offences."
A simple, serious style

We are speaking to engineers and technicians, and our writing must be adapted to suit their mindset. It must be factual and informative. Above all, cliches, hyperboles and superlatives should be avoided.

> Example: "Since this morning, the program aimed at finding security vulnerabilities in OVHcloud infrastructures has been made accessible to everyone on the bountyfactory.io platform. The objective is to continuously improve the services provided by the European leader in cloud technology."

## Ensuring transparency

Transparency is essential in our profession. It is a large part of the reason our customers choose us to host their data. With each piece of content we release, our credibility is at stake.

### Be direct - prioritize substance over form

We must give clear and reliable information, providing figures, dates and examples where possible. Don't include inaccurate information or approximations.

> Example: "Every day, OVHcloud detects and mitigates more than 1,500 attacks targeting our customers' servers. Around a third of these attacks are SYN flood attacks."

### Provide explanations

> Example: "For nearly 10 years now, virtual desktop technology has been regarded as a symbol of modern computer technology. And almost every year, people predict an imminent deployment in companies...but the desired effect is not achieved. Mobility, security, reduced costs and flexibility - all the good reasons to put it into action have not changed much. Just like the underlying technology that hasn't changed radically, but has still improved thanks to the arrival of new editors on the market, such as VMware. So why has OVHcloud waited until 2016 to launch the Cloud Desktop and Cloud Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) solutions? François Loiseau, Senior Cloud Architect of the team that designed these solutions, provides answers to this question."

### Show OVHcloud behind the scenes

> Example: "Go behind the scenes of this project and meet the developers who contributed to it, led by Simon Lelièvre. Together, they reflect on the challenges they faced and the reasoning behind their technical choices, namely the use of open source technology such as OpenWrt and Multi Path TCP, a protocol developed by the Louvain Catholic University in Belgium."

### Preserve certain information

The rules above apply to all content, apart from content associated with customer relations (tracking incidents, for example) and social media platforms. In this case, lying by omission is acceptable: we are not distorting any facts. The habit of preserving certain strategic or sensitive information is accepted by everyone. 

## Conveying a passion

All of our content must reflect our enthusiasm, our involvement and our energy.

> Example: "On Saturday, April 1, the qualifying rounds (quals) were held for the 15th Hack Night. For the fourth year in a row, OVHcloud has supported this French IT security convention. On top of helping organize the event, our teams have made a habit of coming to measure their talent against leading cybersecurity experts in France, Europe and even worldwide, taking part in challenges that get more and more inventive. We would like to share write-ups from our three favourite challenges, from the 22 CTF (Capture The Flag) tests in the qualifying rounds. And this year, the level was very high. Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to the organizers!" https://www.ovh.com/fr/blog/quals-nuit-du-hack-write-up-3-challenges-favoris/

We should also offer a platform for our experts and internal influential figures in all departments.

> Example: David Looses, Digital SEO Specialist at OVHcloud, talks about what's trending in 2016.

It must be noted that statements representing OVHcloud must be approved by the department manager, i.e. one of the CXOs (CTO, CSO, CHRO, CDMO, etc.)

## A culture built on fun

Since the company was founded, humour has been an integral part of OVHcloud's style and communication. Word play with references to tech and geek culture is appreciated.

> Examples: "OVHcloud News - The DDoS that didn't break the camel's VAC", "God save the ping: only 6 months left before the 1st of 3 OVHcloud datacenters in the UK goes live!"
