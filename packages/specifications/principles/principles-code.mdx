# Code principles

## Types
For those who are using types for expressing how a component should be restricted to, it is mostly common to use the
proper way of declaring it.
As of now, we are using two declarations that are exported :
- an _Array_ constant, which contains a read-only array with all values (in case you need values for documentation)
- an _union type_ that can be used elsewhere

>**Example of declaration for a button variant (in TypeScript) :**
>```typescript
>export const ButtonColorValues = ['default', 'primary', 'secondary'] as const;
>export type ButtonColor = typeof ButtonColorValues[number];
>```
>rendering as :
>```text
>ButtonColorValues = readonly ['default', 'primary', 'secondary'];
>ButtonColor = 'default' | 'primary' | 'secondary';
>```
