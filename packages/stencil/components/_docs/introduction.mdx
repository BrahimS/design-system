# Stencil Design System Components

> _NOTE: The Web Components are distributed as ES2017 JavaScript_
> _Modules, and use the Custom Elements API. They are compatible with all modern_
> _browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE11, but an additional_
> _tooling step is required to resolve _bare module specifiers_, as well as_
> _transpilation and polyfills for IE11._

Here below, you can find numerous items referring as components used in the design system. They are categorized based on 
the principles of [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/extending-atomic-design/), presented by 
[Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/).
You can also find attached to each component the related category they are :

* 🅰️ : **Atom** - The foundational building block that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML 
elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken down any further without ceasing to be 
functional.
* ⚛️ : **Molecule** - Simple group of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, 
and button can join together to create a search form molecule.
* 🅾️ : **Organism** - Complex UI component composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. 
Multiple organisms form distinct sections of an interface.
* 🔠 : **Template** - Page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content 
structure. You might see a template as a "page wireframe", i.e. a page with components, but without content.
* 📄 : **Page**/**Layout** - Specific instance of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in 
place.
