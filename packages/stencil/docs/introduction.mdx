# Stencil Design System Components

> NOTE: The Web Components are distributed as ES2017 JavaScript
> Modules, and use the Custom Elements API. They are compatible with all modern
> browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE11, but an additional
> tooling step is required to resolve _bare module specifiers_, as well as
> transpilation and polyfills for IE11.
